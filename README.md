# ZYNQ_module
there are some useful modules which used frequently in ZYNQ

In my daily work, I find a lot of simple but used frequently modules. So, I decided to collect and assemble them. I hope these small modules can help your project, enjoy it!

1. AXIS_FIFO. when I use ZYNQ, it's normal to transfer a bunch of data to PS from PL or vice versa by DAM. So, maybe you need a FIFO with an AXI stream interface to cache your data first and then transfer them by AXI stream protocol.
